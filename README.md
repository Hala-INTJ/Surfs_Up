## Surfs_Up Analysis Summary

Based on the above temperature data analysis, one may conclude that business would be slower in December than in June. To gain more insight, the same approach was completed using precipitation. This analysis shows there's a wide discrepency between the maximum precipitation and both the median and mean.

Since this doesn't given enough information, further analysis was done to determine how many days in each month there was rainfall more than the 75th percentile.

|  | June  | | December  | |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Total Days | 1574 | | 1405 | |
| Rain Days | 927 | 58.9% | 895 | 63.7%  |
| 75th Percentile | 0.12 || 0.15 ||
| Heavy Rain Days | 382 | 24.3% | 341 | 24.3% |

Since the number of days with rain, and the number of days where it rains heavily, are very close between June and December, it is likely that people will purchase as much ice cream in June as in December, and the business should be viable year round.
